# Project documentation writing guidelines

## General Guidelines
- Write clear and concise documentation.
- Use consistent terminology and style.
- Include code examples where applicable.

## Grammar
- Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
- Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
- Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
- Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.

## Markdown Guidelines
- Use headings to organize content.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Include links to related resources.
- Use code blocks for code snippets.

## Code Snippet Policy
- Do not paste whole source files into docs. For large files (Dockerfiles, build config), show a focused excerpt (3-15 lines) and include a link to the full file path in the repository.
- If you must show more than a short excerpt, include a brief one-paragraph summary explaining why the excerpt is included and what to inspect in the full file.
