# Shared Pydantic configuration overrides.
#
# This file ships with the repository so we can codify opinionated defaults
# (for example, shared Cloud Run project IDs) without forcing developers to
# export dozens of environment variables per command. Keep this file focused
# on committed defaults that every environment should inherit.
#
# Developers can create `config/settings.local.toml` (git-ignored) to apply
# laptop-specific settings. Local files follow the exact same schema as the
# Pydantic settings model, which means keys align with the nested sections
# exposed in `src/i4g/settings/config.py`. See the docs/dev_guide.md for
# examples.
#
# Uncomment the sections below to promote a setting to the default layer.
