# Contributing to i4g

> **Welcome!** Thank you for considering contributing to the **i4g (Information for Good)** project. This guide will help you get started.

## About the Project

**i4g** is a volunteer-driven, non-profit platform helping scam victims document and report fraud to law enforcement. We use AI (LangChain + Ollama) to classify scams, extract evidence, and generate police reports.

**Current Status**: Transitioning from prototype to production (Phase 1 MVP in progress)

---

## Who Can Contribute?

We welcome contributions from:

- **Software Engineers**: Python, FastAPI, React, cloud infrastructure
- **Graduate Students**: Computer science, data science, criminology (internship credits available)
- **Security Experts**: Penetration testing, compliance audits
- **UX/UI Designers**: Improving analyst dashboard and victim forms
- **Legal Advisors**: FERPA, GDPR, data privacy guidance
- **Scam Researchers**: Classification taxonomy, emerging fraud trends

**Time Commitment**: Flexible (as low as 2-5 hours/week)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. **Set Up Development Environment**

**Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop
- Git
- Ollama (for local LLM testing)

**Clone the Repository**:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/jsoung/i4g.git
cd i4g
\`\`\`

**Install Dependencies**:
\`\`\`bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

pip install -e ".[dev]"
\`\`\`

**Run Tests**:
\`\`\`bash
pytest tests/ -v
\`\`\`

**Start Local API**:
\`\`\`bash
# In terminal 1: Start Ollama
ollama serve

# In terminal 2: Start FastAPI
python -m i4g.api.app
# API runs at http://localhost:8000
\`\`\`

**Start Dashboard**:
\`\`\`bash
cd src/i4g/dashboard
streamlit run app.py
# Dashboard runs at http://localhost:8501
\`\`\`

### 3. **Create a Feature Branch**

\`\`\`bash
# Always branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch (use descriptive name)
git checkout -b feature/add-spanish-translation
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-pdf-encoding
\`\`\`

**Branch Naming Convention**:
- \`feature/description\`: New functionality
- \`bugfix/description\`: Fixing a bug
- \`docs/description\`: Documentation updates
- \`test/description\`: Adding/improving tests
- \`refactor/description\`: Code cleanup

---

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We follow **PEP 8** with some modifications:

\`\`\`python
# Good
def tokenize_pii(text: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Extract and tokenize PII from raw text.
    
    Args:
        text: Input string potentially containing PII
        
    Returns:
        Mapping of PII type to token ID
    """
    tokens = {}
    for pattern_name, regex in PII_PATTERNS.items():
        matches = regex.findall(text)
        for match in matches:
            token_id = generate_token()
            tokens[pattern_name] = token_id
    return tokens
\`\`\`

**Formatting Tools**:
\`\`\`bash
# Auto-format code
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
\`\`\`

---

### Testing Requirements

**All code changes must include tests!**

**Test Coverage Targets**:
- Unit tests: 80% minimum
- Integration tests: Critical paths only
- E2E tests: Happy path + 1 error case

**Run Tests Before Committing**:
\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_pii_tokenizer.py

# Check coverage
pytest --cov=src/i4g --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
\`\`\`
