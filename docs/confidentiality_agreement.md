# i4g Contributor Confidentiality Agreement (Placeholder)

> **Status**: Draft placeholder â€” the finalized legal document will be uploaded once counsel signs off.  
> **Intended Audience**: Volunteers and partners handling victim data.

Until the official PDF is published, please follow the interim expectations below to protect sensitive information.

## Core Expectations

1. **Keep victim data private.** Do not download, copy, or redistribute evidence outside approved systems.  
2. **Use secure channels.** Discuss case details only in encrypted project tools (Slack with enterprise security, secure email, or approved ticketing systems).  
3. **Report incidents immediately.** If you suspect a leak or policy breach, email `security@i4g.org` within 24 hours.  
4. **Respect data retention rules.** Delete any local artifacts once a task is complete or when asked by maintainers.  
5. **No public disclosure.** Do not reference active cases, victim names, or financial loss totals in talks, social media, or personal portfolios without written approval.

## Next Steps for Contributors

- Continue onboarding and complete the PII handling quiz.  
- Once the final PDF is available, you will be asked to sign and submit it to `legal@i4g.org`.  
- Questions? Contact `legal@i4g.org` or `jerry.soung@gmail.com`.
