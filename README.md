# i4g - Scam/Spam Data Processing Toolkit

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for processing and augmenting datasets related to scams, spam, and other fraudulent activities. The tools help in normalizing data, masking PII, and generating synthetic data for analysis and model training.

## Features

*   **Data Bundling**: Aggregate multiple public scam/spam datasets into a unified JSONL format.
*   **PII Masking**: Automatically find and redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like emails, phone numbers, and URLs.
*   **Text Chunking**: Split large text documents into smaller, manageable chunks suitable for RAG systems.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create realistic chat-style screenshot images from text conversations.
