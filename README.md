# 🧠 i4g — Intelligence for Good

> *Empowering digital safety through AI-driven scam intelligence.*

---

## 🌍 Overview

**i4g** (Intelligence for Good) is an experimental AI platform designed to detect, analyze, and classify online scams — especially **crypto** and **romance scams targeting seniors**.

It integrates **OCR, LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and structured data pipelines** to transform unstructured chat histories into actionable intelligence for fraud prevention and law enforcement support.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The i4g platform aspires to build a complete intelligence lifecycle that:

1. **Analyzes** scam-related communications (chats, screenshots, messages)
2. **Extracts and classifies** key entities, scam types, and patterns
3. **Builds knowledge bases** for analysts and automated systems
4. **Generates structured reports** suitable for law enforcement submission
